# Home automation

Personal home automation repo. (Run on Docker containers on Raspberry Pi.)

## Contents:
- Home Assistant: run in Docker container by running `(sudo) docker-compose up -d` from the `home_assistant` directory, after which HA is accessible from your local network.
- ESPHome: contains configuration files for a livingroom temperature & humidity sensor and for the selfbuilt irrigation system for my vertical garden (aka scyscraper). See `https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html` for running ESPHome in Docker.
